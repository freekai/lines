# Description

This was my first exercise in JavaScript done back in 2012. It's a game
entirely drawn on canvas. No images, very lightweight. In it's initial version,
it's just a big fat `html` file. Let's see if I have time to conver it to
something better over time.

# How to play

The playground is 9 by 9 field. You can move the ball between cells if the path
from one cell to another is not obstructed. After each move, a 3 balls are
added. You need to make a line of 5 or more balls to gain points and make them
disappear.
